# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 4.2.3 - Errors - Errors Activity 2 - Fix your code 2

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Fix your code**

Did you notice that the Agent only builds one level of the wall? 

This is because wehave not instructed the Agent to move vertically.

Lets modify our code to see if we can correct this and it fixes all the errors.

## Step 2 
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 5||`` block and change its direction to up.


```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
		agent.move(UP, 1)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 3
Next let's test the code and observe what happens.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **T** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed?

Not yet - the Agent does now build the wall up but if you count the number of blocks the wall is in length (6) and the number of blocks the wall is high (4) the code still does not do exactly what we want it to do.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

**Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed?** 

Not yet - the Agent does now build the wall up but if you count the number of blocks the wall is in length (6) and the number of blocks the wall is high (4) the code still does not do exactly what we want it to do.

## Step 6 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity (Fix 3) to try and fix your code.
