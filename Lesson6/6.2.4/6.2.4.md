# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 6.2.4 - Errors - Errors Activity 2 - Fix your code
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Fix your code**

Hopefully you noticed that the Agent builds a wall of 11 blocks long by 4 blocks high - not 10 blocks long by 3 blocks high.

Lets modify our code to see if we can correct this and this fixes all the errors.

## Step 2 
Change the number of times the loop runs to 3 and the number of blocks for the Agent to move forward by 9
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
		agent.move(UP, 1)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 9)
		agent.move(UP, 1)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```
## Step 3
Next lets test the code and observe what happens.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed?
Yes - the Agent built a wall 10 blocks long by 3 blocks high?
Did you understand why the Agent built a wall of length 10 blocks even though we told him to move forward by 9 blocks? The 10th block is placed when we move the Agent up.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

**Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed?**


Yes - the Agent built a wall 10 blocks long by 3 blocks high.


**Did you understand why the Agent built a wall of length 10 blocks even though we told him to move forward by 9 blocks?**
The 10th block is placed when we move the Agent up.

## Step  @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity to try and fix your code.
