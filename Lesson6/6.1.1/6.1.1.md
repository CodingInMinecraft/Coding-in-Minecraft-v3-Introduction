# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 4.1.1 - Errors - Errors Activity 1
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will make some mistakes in our code to demonstrate how easy it is to have errors in our code.

We will then try to find and correct the errors.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Building a set of foundations**
You want to create some code which will build the foundations of a square building that has 4 walls.

You have been given the below code by another student to perform the task.

Will it do what you expect it to?

If not what will it do?

Can you find the 2 errors in it?

How would you correct the 2 errors?

If you can answer these questions without running the code the great! If not do not worry as we will create the code to work out the errors.

## Step 3
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and an ``||AGENT:place on move off||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer and place them inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block after the ``||AGENT:place on move off||`` block and change it to repeat 3 times
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Inside the ``||LOOPS:repeat 3 times||`` loop place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and change it to move 4 blocks

After this place an ``||AGENT:agent turn left||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Finally place another ``||AGENT:place on move off||`` block after the first one and change it to an agent destroy obstacles on block by changing the drop down and toggle the off to on. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 7
Next lets test the code and observe what happens.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.

4. Watch your agent appear perform some actions. **What happened? Why did the Agent not place any blocks?** (ensure your agent has blocks in their inventory and notice they will still not place blocks!)

## Step 9
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

**What happened? Why did the Agent not place any blocks?**

## Step 10 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity (Fix 1) to try and fix your code.
