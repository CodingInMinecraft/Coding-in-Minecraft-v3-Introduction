# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 4.3.1 - Errors - Errors Assessment Challenge 1
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this challenge you will need to find and correct the errors so the code works as expected.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Building a tower**
You want to create some code which will build a hollow tower.

The tower's walls will be 4 blocks long each and 6 blocks high.

You have been given the below code by another student to perform the task.

Will it do what you expect it to?

If not what will it do?

Can you find the 4 errors in it?

How would you correct the 4 errors?

## Step 2 
The code from the picture in the previous step is below - can you work out what the 4 errors are?

As a reminder the code should build a hollow tower which is 4 blocks long by 6 block high.

Try and find the errors by updating the code and running it until you find the 4 errors. 

**Note - no additional blocks are required to be added to the code**
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, false)
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @tutorialCompleted
If you have found the 4 errors, take a picture of your MakeCode code and upload to the portal.
Then, return to the game and move onto the next assessment challenge.
