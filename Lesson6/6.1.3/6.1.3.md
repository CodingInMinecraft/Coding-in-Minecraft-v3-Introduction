# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 4.1.3 - Errors - Errors Activity 1 - Fix your code
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Fix your code**

Hopefully you noticed that the Agent only built 3 walls as the repeat loop only runs 3 times rather than 4

Lets modify our code to see if we can correct this and it fixes all the errors.

## Step 2 
Change the 3 in the repeat loop to 4
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 3
Next lets test the code and observe what happens.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed? 
Yes the Agent should build 4 walls (note the agent may destroy the first block when it returns to the start position.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed? 
Yes the Agent should build 4 walls (note the agent may destroy the first block when it returns to the start position.

## Step 6 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non player character.
