# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 6.1.2 - Errors - Errors Activity 1 - Fix your code
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Fix your code**
Hopefully you noticed that the Agent was not placing blocks as the agent place on move was set to false rather than true.

Lets modify our code to see if we can correct this and it fixes all the errors.

## Step 2 
Change the false in the ``||AGENT:place on move false||`` block to true
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 3
Next lets test the code and observe what happens.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed? 
The Agent is now placing blocks but it is only building 3 of the 4 walls. 
Can you figure out why?

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

The Agent is now placing blocks but it is only building 3 of the 4 walls. 
Can you figure out why?

## Step 6 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity (Fix 2) to try and fix your code.
