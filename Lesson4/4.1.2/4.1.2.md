# Introduction to Coding - 4.1.2 - Agent Build - Agent place on move - extension activity 

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will change our code from the previous activity to make the Agent build in a different direction.

## Step 2
On the ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 3||`` block change the direction the Agent will move to the Up direction by changing clicking on the arrow to the right of forward and changing it to Up.
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(UP, 3)
})
```

## Step 3
