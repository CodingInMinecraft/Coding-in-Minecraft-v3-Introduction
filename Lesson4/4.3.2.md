# Introduction to Coding - 3.3.2 - Agent Build - Repeating Actions - extension activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will change our code from the previous activity to make the Agent build in a different directions.

## Step 2
Add another``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` around the existing ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block and change the number of times to repeat to 5


```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.place(BACK)
        }
    }
})
```

## Step 3
After the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` loop and within ``||LOOPS:repeat 5 times||`` loop place the following 4 blocks:
	- ``||AGENT:agent move up by 1||``
	- ``||AGENT:agent turn left||``
	- ``||AGENT:agent turn left||``
	- ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||``

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.place(BACK)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```

## Step 3
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Notice the Agent builds a wall 5 blocks high by 4 blocks longs by repeatedly carrying out 2 processes:
	- Move up and turn 180 degrees
	- Move forward by one block 6 times and each time repeat the process of moving forward and laying a block 4 times.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 6 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non player character.
