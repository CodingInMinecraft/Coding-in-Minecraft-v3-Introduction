# Introduction to Coding - 4.3.1 - Agent Build - Repeating Actions

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use loops in MakeCode to enable our Agent to perform the same action a number of times.

We can use loops to repeat processes such as turning the agent a number of times or making the agent place a number of blocks to create a structure (e.g. building a wall)

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops**

Repeat loops are one of the type of loops available in MakeCode. 

``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` blocks in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer allows us to repeat a series of blocks a set number of times (4 times by default)

Loops will be explored in greater detail in a later unit.

## Step 3
Place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||``  block inside the default ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.

Any blocks we place inside this repeat 4 times block will run one after the other 4 times.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 4
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and an ``||AGENT:agent place back||`` block in the repeat 4 times block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Add an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` and ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block before the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block and change the number of block to move forward to 2
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Next lets test the code.

## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.

## Step 8
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
