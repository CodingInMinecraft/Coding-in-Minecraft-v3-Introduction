# Introduction to Coding - 4.2.1 - Agent Build - Agent place

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode blocks to enable the Agent to build.

We can use the ``||AGENT:agent place forward||`` block to allow us to specify where the agent will place a single block either back, forward, left, right, up or down.

The ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer contains a block ``||AGENT:agent place forward||`` - this blocks enables us to specify that the Agent will place a single block in a particular direction.

## Step 2
Place an ``||AGENT:agent place forward ||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent move up by 3||`` block inside the default ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block. 
Change it to place back.
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(UP, 3)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(UP, 3)
	agent.place(BACK)
})
```

## Step 3
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.


4. Notice the Agent will behave as in the previous activity but at the end will now place a block behind them.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
