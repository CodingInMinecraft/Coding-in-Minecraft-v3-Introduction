# Introduction to Coding - 3.1.1 - Agent Build - Agent place on move

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode blocks to enable the Agent to build.

The ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer contains a block ``||AGENT:agent place on move false||`` - this blocks enables us to specify that the Agent will place a block when they move or not.

## Step 2
Place an ``||AGENT:agent place on move false||``  block inside the default ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
})
```

## Step 3
The default of this block is to tell the Agent not to place blocks when it moves.

Click on the down arrow beside the word false to display the options of true or false.

Change the false value to true.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
})
```

## Step 4
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent place on move true||`` block and change the number of blocks to move to 3.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
})
```

## Step 5
Next lets test the code.

## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.


3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.

4. Notice the message that appears stating "Oops the agent is out of blocks to place in this slot". For the Agent to place blocks we need to put some blocks in the Agents inventory just like if we want to place a block we need to have it in our players inventory.

5. Right click on your Agent to bring up their inventory window. 
	- The top 3 rows of slots represent the inventory slots on the Agent. 
	- The next 3 rows (under the word Inventory) are the blocks in your inventory and the bottom line of slots are the blocks in your hot bar.
	- (If you do not have any blocks in your inventory press the E key to bring up your inventory and add some blocks)

6. Place some blocks in the 1st slot in the Agents inventory. Make sure this is a solid block!

7. Open the chat window and type the word run into the chat bar and click on the chat button or press the return key. Notice that your Agent will move forward by 3 blocks and place a block behind them each time they move.

## Step 7
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
