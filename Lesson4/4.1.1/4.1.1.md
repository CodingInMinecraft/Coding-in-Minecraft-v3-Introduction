# Introduction to Coding - 3.1.1 - Agent Build - Agent place on move

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode blocks to enable the Agent to build.

The ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer contains a block ``||AGENT:agent place on move off||`` - this blocks enables us to specify that the Agent will place a block when they move or not.

## Step 2
Place an ``||AGENT:agent place on move off||``  block inside the default ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
})
```

## Step 3
The default of this block is to tell the Agent not to place blocks when it moves.

Toggle the Off to On on the block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
})
```

## Step 4
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent place on move on||`` block and change the number of blocks to move to 3.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
})
```
