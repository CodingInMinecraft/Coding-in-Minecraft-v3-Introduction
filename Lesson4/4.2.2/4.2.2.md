# Introduction to Coding - 4.2.2 - Agent Build - Agent place - extension activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will change our code from the previous activity to make the Agent place blocks in different directions.

## Step 2
Add 4 more ``||AGENT:agent place forward||`` blocks and change then to place a block left, right, forward and up to place blocks all around our Agent.

```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(UP, 3)
	agent.place(BACK)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.move(UP, 3)
	agent.place(BACK)
	agent.place(FORWARD)
    agent.place(LEFT)
    agent.place(RIGHT)
    agent.place(UP)
})
```
