# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 2.1.1 - Summoning the Agent by Teleportation

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Summoning the Agent by Teleportation**

When you open Code Builder for the first time in a world the Agent will appear at your current position. 

If you move away from that position there are 2 methods you can use to make your Agent move to close to you again.

In this activity we will discover how to teleport the Agent to your current position.

Move your player into the activity zone away from the agent. 

## Step 2 
Open the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer by clicking on the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` on the left hand side of the window.
The ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer contains all the blocks to control the Agent including the ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block which will move the Agent to the players current position.

## Step 3
Drag an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer and place it inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.

Notice how the 2 blocks 'click' together.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})
```
