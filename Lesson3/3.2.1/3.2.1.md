# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 3.2.1 - Controlling your Agent

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode to code in Minecraft.

We will look at how to create blocks of code and how to make your Agent move around the world.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Making your Agent move**

With code you can make your Agent move in one of 6 directions for a specified number of blocks:
	- Forward
	- Backwards
	- Left
	- Right
	- Up
	- Down

## Step 3 
Open the ``||AGENT:AGENT||``  drawer by clicking on the Agent on the left hand side of the window.

In the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer you will find an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block. This is the block we use to move the Agent.
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4
Drag an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.

Notice how the blocks 'click' together.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```

## Step 5
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the bleow steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

## Step 7
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
