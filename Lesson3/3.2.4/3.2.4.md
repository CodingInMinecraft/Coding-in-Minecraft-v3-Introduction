## Step 2
Open the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer by clicking on the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` on the left hand side of the window. In the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer you will find an ``||AGENT:agent turn left||`` block. This is the block we use to turn the Agent.

## Step 3
Place an ``||AGENT:agent turn left||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent move right by 2 ||``block

```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
	agent.move(RIGHT, 2)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
	agent.move(RIGHT, 2)
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
})
```

## Step 4
Click on the down arrow to the right of the word left and notice you can change the direction the Agent will turn. Leave it on Left.

## Step 5
Next lets test the code.
