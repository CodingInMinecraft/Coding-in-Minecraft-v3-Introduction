### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 
Place another ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||``  block after the ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 3||`` 

```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
	agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
	agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```

## Step 2
Click on the down arrow after the word forward and notice how you can change the direction to one of the 6 directions the Agent can move in.

## Step 3
Change the direction to Right and the number of blocks to 2
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
	agent.move(RIGHT, 2)
})
```
