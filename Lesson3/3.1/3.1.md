# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 3.1 - Summoning your Agent

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode to code in Minecraft.

We will look at how to create blocks of code and how to make your Agent appear so you can then make you agent perform tasks.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Opening Code Builder**

Code Builder has been opening automatically for you when you click on some of the non player character buttons so far in this course.

If you want to open Code Builder press the C key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device tap on the Agent button at the top of the screen.

If prompted choose Microsoft MakeCode as the editor.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Opening Code Builder**

When we start a new project in MakeCode there are 2 blocks added by default.

The green on start block is one we will explore in a later unit.

The blue on chat command "run" block is an event handler - this block will contain other blocks that will run when we enter the command run into the Minecraft chat window. This is where we will place our blocks to summon the Agent.
