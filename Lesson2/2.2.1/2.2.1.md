## Step 1 @unplugged
**Mindful Messaging**

Without facial expression or voice inflection digital messages can be misunderstood!

Take a look at the following three messages:

**Message 1:**
![alt text](https://introductionv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.2.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Mindful Messaging")

**Message 2:**
![alt text](https://introductionv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.2.1/images/3.jpg?raw=true "Mindful Messaging")

**Message 3:**
![alt text](https://introductionv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.2.1/images/4.jpg?raw=true "Mindful Messaging")

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Say it Out Loud**

Now say the three different text messages aloud.

Alexa's message (which includes the sad face emoticon) would be said in a soft and disappointed tone.

David's message (which includes exclamation marks) would be said in an excited and enthusiastic tone.

Evan's message (which is written in all caps) would be said in an angry tone.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Think!**

Think about the difference between hearing a sentence said aloud and seeing it typed.

When a sentence is typed, the tone isn't always obvious.

People miss out on communication cues, like seeing facial expressions and body language, or hearing the way a voice sounds.

Without facial expression or voice inflection digital messages can very easily be misconstrued.


## Step 4 @unplugged
**Think!**

Any online communication should be written in a very clear way!

People are increasingly connecting virtually, through texts, Instant Messaging (IM), and emails rather than in person.

That is why **tone** is so important when it comes to sending typed messages.

There are norms or rules that should be followed.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Check Before you Send**

*Would I say this message to someone's face?*

Never send a text, email, comment, or post that you would not say to someone in person.

*Did I check for spelling mistakes?*

Check your spelling to show that you care about your email, and that you are not in a rush.

*Did I use capital letters correctly?*

Be careful when using UPPERCASE letters. It is like SHOUTING.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Ask the Group**

Discuss in your group the following:
- What are some differences between saying something aloud to someone and writing it in an email, text, or IM?
- What are some ways to be respectful when sending an email, text, or IM?
- What should you do before you send an email, text, or IM?

Return to the game and move onto the Assessment NPC at the end of the road.
