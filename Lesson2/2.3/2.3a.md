## Step 1 @unplugged
**Responsible Digital Citizen Challenge**

Now it's time to see if you and your group have understood what it means to be a Responsible Digital Citizen!

As a group you are going to develop a set of norms (rules) that a responsible user of Minecraft should follow. 

Remember to include some rules for effective collaborative working.

First, discuss the list of norms you made that you  follow in class. Then the 'Group Promise' worksheet you completed.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Responsible Digital Citizen Challenge**

Now draft a list of norms that you all agree on as a group.

Hint: Use positive language (do rather than don't).

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Responsible Digital Citizen Challenge**

For this challenge you are going to work collaboratively  in one Minecraft world.

Can you think of a way to display your group's norms on Digital Citizenship Island?

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Signs & Chalkboards**

You could use Signs or Chalkboards!

In Minecraft there is a collection of three different Chalkboards: Slate, Poster, and Board.

The difference is the size: 1?1 (slate), 2?1 (poster), and 2?3 (board), which dictates the amount of  text that they can hold.

All can be found in the Items tab.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Hyperlink from a NPC**

You could use an online document, such as Word Online or Sway, to present your rules and link it to an NPC.

Or you could display your rules in a different way.
The choice is yours!

Once you have decided, its time to join each other in one world to collaborate on the build of the display.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Collaborating in One World**

Choose one person in the group to stay in the Introduction to Coding using MakeCode World and host the world for others to join.

The person who is going to host the world can press the escape key or tap the pause button to pause their game.

On this screen click the Share World tab.

Click on the Start Hosting button to generate a join code.
