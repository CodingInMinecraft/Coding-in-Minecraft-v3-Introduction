## Step 1 @unplugged
**Community**

A **community** is a group of people living in the same place or having something special in common.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**What makes a strong community?**

- How would you describe the people where you live?
- Do most people know each other? Where you live is a type of community. It's your "neighborhood community."
- Can you think of another kind of community? **Clue:** a group of people who share the same interests or goals.


## Step 3 @unplugged
**What makes a strong community?**

Another community that you are a part of is this classroom!
A classroom is a community because students all have something in common. 
For example, similar age and they all have a similar goal - to learn.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**What makes a strong community?**

All the students in this classroom community have agreed to act in a certain way.

These are called norms.

Norms are ways of acting that everyone in a community agrees to.

Norms help people in the community work toward their shared goals.


## Step 5 @unplugged
**What makes a strong community?**

Get a piece of paper and make a list of some of the norms that you all follow in this class.

Keep this list, as it will come in handy for a later activity.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Online Community Norms**

Norms are also important for online communities.

There are different types of online communities and, depending on their goals, they might have different norms that members are expected to follow.
Read the two examples on the next page. Think about how the norm helps the community reach its goal.


## Step 7 @unplugged
**Online Community Norms**

Type of community: Video sites (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo etc.)

Norm: Don't post videos that are mean or inappropriate.

Goal: To watch or share cool videos that entertain or teach.

Question: How does the norm help the online community reach its goal?

Type of community: Online Game (e.g. Minecraft)

Norm: Follow the rules of the game, and don't cheat or "grief" other players.

Goal: To have fun

Question: How does the norm help the online community reach its goal?

## Step 9 @unplugged
**Following Online Norms**

Knowing how to follow the norms of an online community is important because it's part of being a good digital citizen.

A digital citizen is someone who uses technology responsibly to learn, create, and participate.

That means you get the rewards of being online - like seeing cool videos and playing fun games - without the negatives like people being mean or disrespectful to the community.

## Step 12 @unplugged
**Following Online Norms**

It is time for you to work with a group and come up with a norm for how you should act toward others when you're online.

This is going to be part of a promise of how you will act when online.

You can get the "Group Promise" worksheet from the online portal, your teacher, or return to the game and click on the button to download it. (Press "Go Back" and then press "Group Promise."  The document will be downloaded to your files.) 
Complete it as a group activity.

## Step 13 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and complete the Group Promise Activity.
